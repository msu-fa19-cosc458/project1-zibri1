The theme that I chose was Ari Lennox. 

I narrowed the search to just all tweets with Ari Lennox's twitter handle included in their tweet. 
I encountered numerous issues with my project. The first issue I encountered was that my access token for the Genius API was expire, therefore I could not pull any information from Genius. I resolved this by using the access token from the slides but my artists url for the API which worked. Another issue I encountered was that AWS would not allow me to push into Github due to 'online' not being a git repository. I resolved this issue by using the "change directory" command back to environment, and then it allowed me to push. The final issue I occured that I will discuss was a "no module named requests_oauthlib" error. I resolved this by going back and reading over the READme for the course on Github. My issue was that I did not include my requests_oauthlib library in my requirements.txt file. I then went back and implemented it into my file and the error was fixed.

I do not have any problems with my project as of now.

To improve my project in the future, I would give myself a more ample amount of time to do research and understand what the project entails. I would then approach it differently instead of trying to learn all of the material while doing the project. That is what held me back the most during the completion of the web app. I will also reach out to you for questions instead of holding back.
